### Doggos Quiz Game
#### Get Know Of The Doggos Quiz And What We Need To Match The Requierments
`
### First Task: Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators

## Requierments 
In the checkSign function, use multiple conditional operators - following the recommended format used in findGreaterOrEqual - to check if a number is positive, negative or zero. The function should return positive, negative or zero.[click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-multiple-conditional-ternary-operators) 

### The Solution :
```js
function checkSign(num) {
  return (num >0) ? "positive" 
    : (num<0) ? "negative" 
    : "zero";

}
checkSign(10);
}

```
### Second Task: Golf Code

## Requierments 

In the game of Golf, each hole has a par, meaning, the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

Strokes	Return
1	"Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2	"Eagle"
par - 1	"Birdie"
par	"Par"
par + 1	"Bogey"
par + 2	"Double Bogey"
>= par + 3	"Go Home!"

 par and strokes will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience. [click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/golf-code) 



### The Solution :
```js
const names = ["Hole-in-one!", "Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Go Home!"];

function golfScore(par, strokes) {
  // Only change code below this line
    if (strokes === 1) {
    return names[0];
  } else if (strokes <= par - 2) {
    return names[1];
  } else if (strokes === par - 1) {
    return names[2];
  } else if (strokes === par) {
    return names[3];
  } else if (strokes === par + 1) {
    return names[4];
  } else if (strokes === par + 2) {
    return names[5];
  } else {
    return names[6];
  }
  return "Change Me";
  // Only change code above this line
}

golfScore(5, 4);
```
### Third Task: Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array

## Requierments 

The watchList array holds objects with information on several movies. Use map on watchList to assign a new array of objects to the ratings variable. Each movie in the new array should have only a title key with the name of the film, and a rating key with the IMDB rating. The code in the editor currently uses a for loop to do this, so you should replace the loop functionality with your map expression.[click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/use-the-map-method-to-extract-data-from-an-array)

### The Solution :
```js
// The global variable
const watchList = [

### Fourth Task: Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array

The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use a combination of filter and map on watchList to assign a new array of objects with only title and rating keys. The new array should only include objects where imdbRating is greater than or equal to 8.0. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and you may need to convert them into numbers to perform mathematical operations on them.
