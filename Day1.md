#### Here We Discussed Topics Such As: What is JavaScript,Where to Write JavaScript .
-Section 2: DOM
#### Here I'm Leaned About DOM And How To Use It To Deal And Mainten With Web Pages .
-Section 3: Values & Data Types
#### In This Section I Got To Know Data Types In Js and How To Declear Variables And Assigned It To Values .

#### Discusses The Various Operators In JavaScript, Arithmetic Operators And Logical Operations

## Task requirements
-First Task: Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication .

Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator. [click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-multiplication) 

### The Solution :
```js
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```
-Second Task: Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: This is the first sentence. and This is the second sentence. using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the example and be sure to include a space between the two strings. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string .

### The Solution :
```js
let myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
```
-Third Task: Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string. [click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-to-last-character-in-a-string)

### The Solution :
```js
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length -2]; // Change this line
```
